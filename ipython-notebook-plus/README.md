Docker IPython Container (Plus)
===============================

IPython running in a docker container. This image can be used to integrate IPython into Galaxy.
A variety of different packages are pre-installed and can be used right away.

This docker container is used by the [Galaxy-IPython project](https://github.com/bgruening/galaxy-ipython)
and can be installed from the [docker.io index](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/bgruening/galaxy-ipython-notebook-plus/).

This image builds on top of https://github.com/bgruening/docker-ipython-notebook
and adds a few extra dependencies. The Image will be used by workshops and Trainings
and the pre-installed package set will change. Please don't rely on this image it will
change a lot over time. Take it as inspiration to build your own Image.
