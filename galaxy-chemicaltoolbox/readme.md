ChemicalToolBox
===============

The **ChemicalToolBox** is a set of tools integrated into the Galaxy-workflow-management system to enable researchers easy-to-use, reproducible, and transparent access to cheminformatics libraries and drug discovery tools. It includes standard applications for similarity and substructure searches, clustering of compounds, prediction of properties and descriptors, filtering, and many other tools that range from drug-likeness classification to fragmentation and fragment-merging. By combinating the various tools many more powerful applications can be designed.

ChemicalToolBox is based on open-source software, web-accessible, freely available, and easily expandable. It can be downloaded and easily deployed locally or on a large scale cluster.

**Galaxy** is an open, web-based platform for data intensive research. All tools can be combined in workflows without any need of programming skills. Furthermore the platform can be extended with more tools at any time. Each tool has its own information about what it does and how the input is supposed to look like. You can make data available for Galaxy by uploading local files or downloading online content. Inputfiles, workflowsteps and results are stored in a history where you can view them or reaccess them later. It is possible to share workflows and histories with other users or make the public available. Saved workflows can be used with new input files or just to rerun an analyses which ensures repeatability.
