ChemicalToolBox Docker Image
============================

The [ChemicalToolBox](https://github.com/bgruening/galaxytools/tree/master/chemicaltoolbox) (CTB) is a set of tools integrated into the [Galaxy-workflow-management](http://galaxyproject.org) system to enable researchers easy-to-use, reproducible, and transparent access to cheminformatics libraries and drug discovery tools. It includes standard applications for similarity and substructure searches, clustering of compounds, prediction of properties and descriptors, filtering, and many other tools that range from drug-likeness classification to fragmentation and fragment-merging. By combinating the various tools many more powerful applications can be designed.

ChemicalToolBox is based on open-source software, web-accessible, freely available, and easily expandable. It can be downloaded and easily deployed locally or on a large scale cluster.

With the CTB Docker Image we provide a full Galaxy installation with PostgreSQL and Apache. CTB is preinstalled with all dependencies and one example workflow to make it even more easier to install and test the future of large-scale cheminformatics.
